📝 Problem Statement
POWERGRID executes large-scale infrastructure projects such as substations, overhead lines, and underground cables. These projects face cost overruns and schedule delays due to factors like terrain, regulatory hurdles, weather, vendor reliability, and resource availability.
The objective is to build a predictive software system that forecasts project costs and completion timelines accurately by identifying relationships and dependencies across structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data sources.
